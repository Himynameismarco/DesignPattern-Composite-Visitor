# DesignPattern: Visitor
I wanted to test creating a visitor design pattern. I did it using simple operations. 

I decided to do the evaluations in the TermEvaluator class, because this seems to be what the pattern is about. 
To me, it would have made more sense, declaring an abstract method "getResult()" in the BinaryExpression class.
